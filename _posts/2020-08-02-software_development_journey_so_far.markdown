The road to me enrolling in school and deciding to become a developer has been a long one. 

I've always been the kind of person that hates making decisions and will take things that happen to me/around me as a sign of what to do next. For example; if I didn't know what I wanted for lunch I would assume that my phone falling out of my hand meant I should just have a quick slice of pizza, or if I couldn't decide whether to watch a show or movie, I would take the jingle that played in a commercial as a sign to watch the show. 

I always wanted to do something in tech, but I didn't know what. I never liked school and was proud of being an average student with minimal effort. I decided I wouldn't go to university until I was 100% sure. 

I began hearing of coding a lot about 3 years ago and I was interested, but only mildly because my life is really busy. I downloaded some apps but they were confusing so I ended up letting them go shortly after. Coding was in the back of my mind until I started working at my current job, which is a block away from the Google offices in Chelsea. Before I got that job (almost 2 years ago) I started thinking about coding again- seeing ads, hearing about it online and from other people, but the biggest impression of all was when I had a friend who enrolled at this school. I went to her birthday party and it was 80% made up of her classmates, so during the party they kept telling me I should definitely pursue it, and saying Flatiron was a great choice- but still I wasn't ready to enroll.

When I began my current job, I would talk to the patients about random things all the time and coding would come up either from them mentioning working at Google, or from myself and the dentist talking while working on the patient, who just so happened to work at Google. It's funny actually, we noticed that whenever coding would organically come up in conversation, it would turn out that the patient works at Google!

So I decided to self teach. I enrolled in Codecademy and went at it for a few weeks but I noticed it was getting more and more difficult because after years of not putting effort into school, I had horrible study skills and little to no ability to focus.

My motivation was at its lowest and I knew I was going to give up soon, but one day I decided I'd bring my laptop with me to work and study during my lunch break. This didn’t work out because the gap in the schedule ended up getting filled. So then I decided I'd go to the park to study. I got to the park and realized I couldn't do that either because my laptop AND phone were dying. So then I went to the nearby Apple store instead to study while my devices charged. This store in particular had 3 different floors, and I had *never* been to it before. I walked in on autopilot and found myself on the 2nd floor, in the middle row of these lined up tables. Not more than 2 minutes go by when I hear "Okay everybody, let’s talk about coding!" I look up and see that the table next to me has 1 empty seat left and the screen says "Intro to Coding For Beginners".

The sign of all signs.

I decided right there that I couldn't ignore any more signs and that I had to take this journey seriously. There were a bunch of other signs after this too, right up until I finally enrolled at Flatiron.
